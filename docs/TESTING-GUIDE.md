await page.route('/api/projects/workflow', route => {
  route.fulfill({
    status: 500,
    contentType: 'application/json',
    body: JSON.stringify({ success: false, error: 'Simulated server error' })
  })
})
```

**Recovery Mechanisms**

## ðŸ“ˆ Test Results and Reporting

### **Automated Report Generation**

The comprehensive test runner generates multiple report formats:

**HTML Report** (`test-results/comprehensive/comprehensive-test-report.html`)
- Visual test results with pass/fail indicators
- Execution time and performance metrics
- Screenshots and error details for failed tests
- System configuration and environment info

**JSON Report** (`test-results/comprehensive/comprehensive-test-report.json`)
- Machine-readable test results
- Detailed test execution metadata
- System information and configuration
- Performance metrics and timing data

**Playwright HTML Report** (`playwright-report/comprehensive/index.html`)

  testTimeout: 300000,     // 5 minutes per test
  workers: 1,              // Sequential execution
  retries: 1,              // Retry failed tests once
  browsers: ['chromium'],  // Primary browser testing
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  outputDir: './test-results/comprehensive',
  reportDir: './playwright-report/comprehensive'
}
```
